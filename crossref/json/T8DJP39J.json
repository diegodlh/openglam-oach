Recently, American archives and archivists have come under fire for pervasive homogeneity - for privileging, preserving, and reproducing a history that is predominantly white and further silencing the voices and histories of marginalized peoples and communities. This paper argues that as such, archives participate in a continuing amnesty that prevents transitional and restorative justice for black Americans in the United States. Using the history of lynching in America as a backdrop, this article explores the records and counter-narratives archives need to embrace in order to support truth and reconciliation processes for black Americans in the age of #ArchivesForBlackLives.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.24242/jclis.v1i2.42", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 8, 28]], "date-time": "2017-08-28T21:04:41Z", "timestamp": 1503954281000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["Archival Amnesty: In Search of Black American Transitional and Restorative Justice"], "prefix": "10.24242", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "Tonia", "family": "Sutherland", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "10335", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 6, 5]]}, "container-title": ["Journal of Critical Library and Information Studies"], "link": [{"URL": "https://journals.litwinbooks.com/index.php/jclis/article/download/42/27", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://journals.litwinbooks.com/index.php/jclis/article/download/42/27", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2019, 3, 17]], "date-time": "2019-03-17T23:33:03Z", "timestamp": 1552865583000}, "score": 111.81574, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2017, 6, 5]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 19]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v1i2.42", "ISSN": ["2572-1364"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2572-1364", "type": "electronic"}]}
