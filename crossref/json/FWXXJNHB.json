Images of objects (cultural material) in the digital environment support cultural heritage. Institutions are developing complex solutions relevant in the network environment to further repatriation initiatives. These solutions facilitate discovery, opening avenues for research into the ethics of ownership that cross the physical/digital divide. There have been calls for strengthening the potential for use of pertinent information in order to protect and recover cultural heritage through increased visibility. However, some museums still limit access to images. We examine the issues and their implications referencing case studies specific to Indigenous, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples of Canada.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.3390/heritage2020081", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 29]], "date-time": "2019-04-29T06:57:32Z", "timestamp": 1556521052000}, "page": "1260-1273", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Giving Diligence Its Due: Accessing Digital Images in Indigenous Repatriation Efforts"], "prefix": "10.3390", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "Susan", "family": "Douglas", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"ORCID": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1622-2025", "authenticated-orcid": false, "given": "Melanie", "family": "Hayes", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1968", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 4, 27]]}, "reference": [{"key": "ref1", "DOI": "10.3138/CHR/86.1.83", "doi-asserted-by": "publisher"}, {"key": "ref2", "year": "2006", "series-title": "Libr@ries: Changing Information Space and Practice"}, {"key": "ref3", "author": "Cameron", "year": "2007", "article-title": "Digital Knowledgescapes: Cultural, Theoretical, Practical, and Usage Issues Facing Museum Collections Databases in a Digital Epoch", "series-title": "Theorizing Digital Cultural Heritage: A Critical Discourse"}, {"key": "ref4", "unstructured": "Three Years Later, Is Canada Keeping Its Truth and Reconciliation Commission Promises?
