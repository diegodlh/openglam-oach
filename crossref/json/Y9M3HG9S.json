It discusses the key elements required for a broadly collaborative effort to (1) identify, cultivate, and promote the digital art resources that already exist; (2) develop new online projects; and (3) weave these resources together in a fashion that allows both online and offline arts activities to receive the serious attention to study they deserve. In addition to enhanced public sector leadership and expanded private sector support, the chapter calls for a more systematic application of curatorial expertise to the online sector, along with substantial grassroots participation in identifying the most reliable cultural resources that are too often lost in the vast expanses of the commercialized Internet today.</p>", "DOI": "10.7551/mitpress/9780262034654.003.0030", "type": "book-chapter", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 5, 18]], "date-time": "2017-05-18T12:42:24Z", "timestamp": 1495111344000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From Archaeology to Architecture: Building a Place for Noncommercial Culture Online"], "prefix": "10.7551", "author": [{"given": "Gary O.", "family": "Larson", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "281", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2017, 5, 18]]}, "container-title": ["Social Media Archeology and Poetics"], "original-title": ["From Archaeology to Architecture: Building a Place for Noncommercial Culture Online"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 12, 18]], "date-time": "2018-12-18T09:39:35Z", "timestamp": 1545125975000}, "score": 39.49303, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2016, 8, 19]]}, "ISBN": ["9780262034654", "9780262336871"], "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7551/mitpress/9780262034654.003.0030"}
