The Digital Humanities has become a dynamic and fertile research field, and new projects and opportunities are constantly flourishing. The BYZART project perfectly fits this context. This project is coordinated by the Department of History and Cultures of the University of Bologna, embracing a wide consortium of partners from Bulgaria, Greece and Italy. It aims at enhancing Byzantine and Post-Byzantine artistic and cultural heritage within the Europeana\u00a0platform. This project will enrich the existing Europeanacollections with about 75,000 new cultural and artistic multimedia objects relevant to Byzantine history and culture, including collections of digitized photos, video and audio content, and 3-D surveys and reconstructions. We have also established a liaison between the new materials and Byzantine-related content already existing on Europeana. The archival material collected and digitized by the BYZART consortium is of the greatest cultural and art-historical importance, but until now, it has not been properly evaluated or published. For this reason, BYZART aims to guarantee the preservation and evaluation of significant cultural heritage objects from a wide range of contexts, while also making them accessible to scholarly and general audiences alike.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.14434/sdh.v3i2.27721", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2020, 6, 26]], "date-time": "2020-06-26T01:30:36Z", "timestamp": 1593135036000}, "page": "144-155", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage Preservation"], "prefix": "10.14434", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Giulia", "family": "Marsili", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Lucia Maria", "family": "Orlandi", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "5570", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2020, 6, 13]]}, "container-title": ["Studies in Digital Heritage"], "link": [{"URL": "https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/sdh/article/download/27721/35210", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/sdh/article/download/27721/35210", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2020, 6, 26]], "date-time": "2020-06-26T01:30:39Z", "timestamp": 1593135039000}, "score": 27.418358, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2020, 6, 13]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2019, 12, 31]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.14434/sdh.v3i2.27721", "ISSN": ["2574-1748"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2574-1748", "type": "electronic"}]}
