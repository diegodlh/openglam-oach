The preferred approach is a leading indicators\n      model, in which broad money growth and private sector credit growth help\n      forecast inflation. A univariate approach also yields reasonable\n      forecasts, but seems less suited to capturing turning-points. A vector\n      autoregressive (VAR) model illustrates how monetary developments can be\n      described by a Phillips-curve-type relationship.
