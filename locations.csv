3WITW2C4,blogPost,2020.0,,A Symposium to Center Latin American and Caribbean Partners • CLIR,CLIR,,,,https://www.clir.org/2020/07/a-symposium-to-center-latin-american-and-caribbean-partners/,"This is part one of a two-part interview with the organizers of “Capacity Assessment of Latin American and Caribbean Partners: A Symposium about Open-Access, Technological Needs, and Institutional Sustainability,” which took place virtually April 16-17, 2020. Part two will be published tomorrow, July 14. In this piece, Nicole Kang Ferraiolo, CLIR’s Director of Global Strategic Initiatives, interviews:    Hadassah St. Hubert, CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow at Digital Library of the Caribbean at Florida International University Jennifer Isasi, Assistant Director of the Digital Pedagogy and Scholarship Office and Director of the Digital Liberal Arts Initiative at Penn State University Nicté Fuller Medina, CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles Libraries in Data Curation in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Margie Montañez, Humanities Librarian at the University of New Mexico and a previous CLIR fellow for Data Curation for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at UNM Can you provide a brief overview of the Latin American and Caribbean partners symposium? Hadassah St. Hubert: The full title was Capacity Assessment of Latin American and Caribbean Partners: A Symposium about Open Access, Technological Needs and Institutional Sustainability. The symposium was a microgrant project through CLIR’s Data Curation Fellowships in Latin American and Caribbean Studies, funded by the Mellon Foundation. The conference took place April 16th and 17th; it was initially intended to be an in-person event but was held via Zoom and live stream on Facebook because of COVID-19. The intended audience for the symposium was people who do post custodial archival work, our partners in Latin America and the Caribbean, and then funding institutions that support digitization projects in these areas. In total we had 126 people participating via Zoom and over 1,700 views on Facebook. Nicté Fuller Medina: It was for the cultural heritage institutions, libraries, and archives in Latin America and the Caribbean. It was about connecting them with resources and creating a space for a conversation with institutions in the US and Canada. Margie Montañez: At the end of the day, we had partners from six different countries: Mexico, Colombia, Haiti, Jamaica, Barbados, and the US. Jennifer Isasi: Also the keynote was in Argentina and the audience was also from several other countries.  What were the symposium’s goals? Margie Montañez: One of the major goals was to find out what the institutions in Latin America and in the Caribbean needed from their US partner institutions. A second goal was to talk with our partner institutions about technical capabilities. Third, we wanted to talk about who they see using their materials and how can we help them get these digitized materials to their intended audiences. Hadassah St. Hubert: We also wanted to create a set of guidelines and recommendations for libraries and archives in the US and Canada, and for those who fund these projects, based on the conversations at the symposium. Nicté Fuller Medina: The idea was to get insights from the institutions in the Caribbean and Latin America, so that these partnerships are more transparent, and so there was a platform for those voices. Because of the power dynamic between the so-called global North and global South, a lot of what happens relies on individual institutions. We wanted to be able to provide a broader picture. Jennifer Isasi: Another thing that we did is bring institutions together from the region. We found that they often don’t know each other, and by creating this group, they can now share information. What were some of the considerations you had in mind when designing it? Nicté Fuller Medina: One of the things that we wanted to do was to make sure that the invited institutions from the Caribbean and Latin America had a space to showcase the work that they were doing for an international audience. And then we wanted to put them in the same room with funders to demystify that whole process and put a face to funding programs. The microgrant we received was so important because it takes funding to be able to facilitate participation from the global South because of how the North-South divide operates. Hadassah St. Hubert: I just wanted to add a brief note about how we selected our keynotes. We did a survey of the Latin American and Caribbean partners before the symposium, and they were chosen as a result of the topics. Open access was one of their topics that they wanted to learn about and that’s why we chose Gimena del Rio Riande. Margie Montañez: We were very intentional about centering the voices from our partner institutions, so that it wasn’t about the needs of a US researcher or the needs of a US institution. What are the next steps for this project? Jennifer Isasi: We are developing guidelines and recommendations with different audiences in mind. We have a section for institutions in the global North that have an interest in digitizing and curating materials from Latin America and the Caribbean; we have a set of recommendations for institutions that are funding these projects, and one for the institutions in the Caribbean and Latin America. I will say that overall, the recommendation is that there be more communication and community creation among them. For instance, US and Canada-based institutions could reduce the burdens on Latin American and Caribbean partners by making paperwork easier or taking on the cost of translation work, particularly in the case of grant applications. Nicté Fuller Medina: We’ll be making these recommendations public along with the recordings of the sessions. We’re planning to translate them into Spanish, French, and possibly Portuguese. Jennifer has also started working on captioning for the videos. It’s important to us to translate what we are producing so that it’s accessible to institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. The second part of this interview, focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the symposium, will be published tomorrow. Recordings of the symposium sessions can be found here. The forthcoming recommendations and guidelines are expected to be available in fall 2020 on the symposium Read More",2020-07-13,2020-07-23 15:33:55,2020-07-23 15:33:55,2020-07-23 15:33:55,,,,,,,,,,,,,en-US,,,,,,,Library Catalog: www.clir.org,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/SKNHREKR/a-symposium-to-center-latin-american-and-caribbean-partners.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['*WORK IN'],['*WORK IN'],False,False,False,False,True,,,,,Error: Type not supported,,Error: Type not supported,,,

This paper argues that there are five key erroneous assumptions about the nature of inequality in globalising informational economies which underpin much of this debate—both on an academic and popularist level. The paper argues that it is of fundamental importance that these assumptions are critically examined if the futures of communications policy and planning are to adequately address questions of inequality in relation to information, knowledge and communications. Indeed, failure to examine these assumptions may lead futurists and social scientists (particularly in the West) to become complicit in distracting attention away from the very ‘real’ global economic, social and cultural inequalities, to ‘virtual’ inequalities which merely hide an unwillingness to address the core failings of the ‘development’ paradigm.",2000-09-01,2020-07-20 18:40:21,2020-07-20 18:40:21,2020-07-20 18:40:21,679-694,,7,32.0,,Futures,Beyond the ‘information rich and poor’,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/4UP3Q9VG/S0016328700000161.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['*WORK IN'],['*WORK IN'],False,False,False,False,True,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1016/S0016-3287(00)00016-1,,exact,,Beyond the ‘information rich and poor’: futures understandings of inequality in globalising informational economies,

A year later the world witnessed this through horrifying videos on social media. Responding to this unimaginable cultural loss, Iranian-born artist and activist Morehshin Allahyari initiated Material Speculation: Isis—creating 3D-printed replicas of twelve of the destroyed sculptures from the cities of Hatra and Nineveh. The project involved collecting extensive data and research with various historians, curators, and visual archives, which Allahyari placed on USB flash drives and embedded within the body of the statues. In her current series, She Who Sees the Unknown, she looks at stories from the South West Asian and North African (SWANA) region, re-figuring images of goddesses and djinns through a feminist lens as a way of weaving new magical narratives and speculating mythologies., In this conversation with Allahyari, I discuss her artistic and research processes, unpacking issues of digital decolonization.

Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc. delivered was hailed both as a landmark decision and a legal bomb. Was Feist so original as to deserve all the attention? After all, it did not establish a new originality paradigm as such but only ended a long division among federal circuits concerning the protection under copyright of factual compilations. A number of circuits had adopted a test similar to the one articulated in Feist (i.e., based on creative selection), while others required only evidence of labor, a test known as sweat of the brow.   In reality, Feist did much more than resolve a definitional tension: it determined that there was a constitutional requirement of creativity.  According to the U.S. database industry, the sky had fallen: factual compilations would no longer be protected and without adequate protection, investments necessary for the creation and maintenance of databases would dry up.  That did not happen, even though debates concerning a federal tort of misappropriation continue.  The purpose of this article is not to analyze whether Feist was correctly decided, but rather to show that a Feist like standard is now applied or may soon emerge in key common law countries. Moreover, in a move that may bridge the gap between the two major systems of copyright, we will demonstrate that civil law systems have also adopted a similar doctrine.",2002,2020-06-18 11:38:27,2020-06-18 11:38:27,2016-12-02 19:08:28,949-981,,,49.0,,,Feist Goes Global,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/MGA5CDLX/Gervais - 2002 - Feist Goes Global A Comparative Analysis Of The N.pdf,,,comparative law; copyright; creativity; Feist; originality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > LATE ADDS > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.4337/9781848440210.00007,,52.663395,,A Canadian copyright narrative,

Artists strive to be “original,” however the term is understood by each of them.  It is also one of the major concepts in copyright law.  This paper considers the evolution of the notion of originality since 2002 (when one of the coauthors published an article entitled Feist Goes Global: A Comparative Analysis Of The Notion Of Originality In Copyright Law) and continues the analysis, in particular whether the notion of “creative choices,” which seems to have substantial normative heft in several jurisdictions, is optimal when measured in more operational terms.   The paper considers the four traditional silo-like notions of originality used in national legal systems and looks at the major international treaties for guidance in defining the parameters of an international notion of originality.  It analyzes the silos and suggests that they take the form of constellations which cannot be defined or compared hierarchically or indeed as completely separate notions; rather, they overlap in myriad ways.",2010,2020-06-18 11:38:10,2020-06-18 11:38:10,2017-01-13 15:45:01,375-408,,,27.0,,,Of Silos and Constellations,,,,,,,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/SR49E3TG/papers.html,,,copyright; creativity; Feist; originality; CCH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > LATE ADDS > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1525/lal.1993.5.2.02a00070,,27.13062,,Re: Law and Literature... and History,

Alison Adam admirably fills the large gap in science and technology studies by showing us that gender bias is inscribed in AI-based computer systems. Her treatment of feminist epistemology, focusing on the ideas of the knowing subject, the nature of knowledge, rationality and language, are bound to make a significant and powerful contribution to AI studies. Drawing from theories by Donna Haraway and Sherry Turkle, and using tools of feminist epistemology, Adam provides a sustained critique of AI which interestingly re-enforces many of the traditional criticisms of the AI project. Artificial Knowing is an esential read for those interested in gender studies, science and technology studies, and philosophical debates in AI.",1998,2020-04-19 12:33:53,2020-06-16 15:00:25,,,220.0,,,,,Artificial Knowing,,,,,Routledge,English,,,,,,,,,,https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artificial-Knowing-Gender-Thinking-Machine/dp/041512963X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.4324/9780203005057,,39.699326,,Artificial Knowing,London; New York
9ADNHCLP,book,1996.0,"Drahos, Peter",A Philosophy of Intellectual Property,,978-1-85521-240-4,,,,"Are intellectual property rights like other property rights? More and more of the world’s knowledge and information is under the control of intellectual property owners. What are the justifications for this? What are the implications for power and for justice of allowing this property form to range across social life? Can we look to traditional property theory to supply the answers or do we need a new approach? Intellectual property rights relate to abstract objects - objects like algorithms and DNA sequences. The consequences of creating property rights in such objects are far reaching. A Philosophy of Intellectual Property argues that lying at the heart of intellectual property are duty-bearing privileges. We should adopt an instrumentalist approach to intellectual property and reject a proprietarian approach - an approach which emphasizes the connection between labour and property rights. The analysis draws on the history of intellectual property, legal materials, the work of Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke, Marx and Hegel, as well as economic, sociological and legal theory. The book is designed to be accessible to specialists in a number of fields as well as students. It will interest philosophers, political scientists, economists, legal scholars as well as those professionals concerned with policy issues raised by modern technologies and the information society.",1996,2020-04-21 07:00:10,2020-06-16 15:00:22,,,272.0,,,,,,,,,,Routledge,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1 edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],[],False,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.22459/pip.06.2016,,50.15082,,A Philosophy of Intellectual Property,"Aldershot; Brookfield, USA"

Hardware, software, and cultural expectations combine to make some technologies an easier fit for some bodies than for others. A YouTube video without closed captions or a social network site that is incompatible with a screen reader can restrict the access of users who are hard of hearing or visually impaired. Often, people with disabilities require accommodation, assistive technologies, or other forms of aid to make digital media accessible--usable--for them. Restricted Access investigates digital media accessibility--the processes by which media is made usable by people with particular needs--and argues for the necessity of conceptualizing access in a way that will enable greater participation in all forms of mediated culture. Drawing on disability and cultural studies, Elizabeth Ellcessor uses an interrogatory framework based around issues of regulation, use, content, form, and experience to examine contemporary digital media. Through interviews with policy makers and accessibility professionals, popular culture and archival materials, and an ethnographic study of internet use by people with disabilities, Ellcessor reveals the assumptions that undergird contemporary technologies and participatory cultures. Restricted Access makes the crucial point that if digital media open up opportunities for individuals to create and participate, but that technology only facilitates the participation of those who are already privileged, then its progressive potential remains unrealized. Engagingly written with powerful examples, Ellcessor demonstrates the importance of alternate uses, marginalized voices, and invisible innovations in the context of disability identities to push us to rethink digital media accessibility.""--Provided by publisher",2016,2020-06-15 14:00:50,2020-06-15 14:00:50,2020-06-15 14:00:50,,,,,,,Restricted access,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 938018332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.18574/nyu/9781479813803.003.0001,,81.84036,,Introduction,

L8YVCEH3,report,2019.0,"Bietti, Elettra",Consent as a Free Pass: Platform Power and the Limits of the Informational Turn,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3489577,"Across the United States and Europe, notice and consent, the act of clicking that “I have read and agree” to a platform’s terms of service, is the central device for legitimating and enabling platforms’ data processing, acting as a free pass for a variety of intrusive activities which include profiling and behavioral advertising. Notwithstanding literature and findings that lay significant doubts on notice and consent’s adequacy as a regulatory device in the platform ecosystem, courts, regulators and other public authorities across these regions keep adopting and legitimating these practices. Yet while consent seems a good proxy for ensuring justice in the platform economy, it is an empty construct. This paper shows and explains how notice and consent practices in the platform economy are not only normatively futile but also positively harmful. Narrow understandings that focus on voluntariness and disclosure such as the ones generally adopted by regulators and courts fail to account for the unjust background conditions within which voluntary individual acts of consent take place, nudged by design constraints, obscured by knowledge asymmetries, fed by ideological false consciousness. Through such narrow approaches, regulators are failing to acknowledge that consent cannot be reasonably taken to morally transform the rights, obligations and relationships that it is purports to reshape. Further, it positively harms consumers in at least three ways: burdening them with decisions they cannot meaningfully make, subordinating their core inalienable rights to respect and dignity to the economic interests of platforms, and creating widespread ideological resistance against alternatives. Notice and consent as a discourse is hardly contestable and is currently part of the rigid background of assumed facts about our digital environment.

However, close examination of the EU Term Directive’s intricate provisions reveals a piecemeal and permissive approach to harmonisation which preserves many differences between the national rules. In this report, four main sources of legislative variability are identified and analysed: a) contagion from unharmonised areas of substantive copyright law; b) explicit exceptions to the harmonisation of the term of protection; c) national related rights of unharmonised term; and d) incorrect implementation of the provisions of the Term Directive into national law.  As a result, the desired harmonising effect has not been fully achieved: although a single rule may be applicable across the EU in theory, drastically divergent terms of protection may attach to the same information product depending on the jurisdiction within which protection is sought. In this way, the territorial nature of copyright undercuts harmonisation efforts, forcing the public domain to contract and expand according to divergent national rules. The result is a legislative framework that makes cross-border rights clearance calculation difficult, hampering end-users and cultural heritage organisations from taking full avail of the new opportunities now technically available for the digitisation and exploitation of the public domain. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary.",2012-09-13,2019-11-03 21:32:22,2019-11-03 21:32:22,2015-04-16 11:15:33,,,,,,,The Myth of European Term Harmonisation,,,,,Social Science Research Network,,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,00002,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/243TC6SB/papers.html,,government policy,Copyright and related rights; European copyright harmonisation; public domain; term of protection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ID 2145862,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.2139/ssrn.2145862,,96.68565,,The Myth of European Term Harmonisation: 27 Public Domains for the 27 Member States,"Rochester, NY"

L.J.,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1085267,"Memory institutions are social entities that select, document, contextualize, preserve, index and thus canonize elements of humanity's culture, historical narratives, individual and collective memories. Archives, museums and libraries are paradigmatic examples for traditional memory institutions. Content-sharing platforms, social networks, peer-to-peer file-sharing infrastructures, digital images agencies, online music stores and search engines' utilities represent emerging novel entities with a de-facto derivative function as networked memory institutions. This article includes an in-depth inquiry regarding the manners in which digitization and networked communication technologies implicate on the identity, structure and attributes of society's memory institutions. More specifically, I focus on privatization processes that networked memory institutions are increasingly undergoing. My basic hypothesis is that the transformation from tangible/analogue preservation to digitized cultural retrieval tends to result in intense privatization of society's memory institutions - both traditional and novel ones. Among other aspects, I examine the fundamental role of copyright law in facilitating and supporting these dynamics of privatization. The article then analyzes the consequences of privatizing memory institutions in the light of their unique social functions in a democratic culture. Commercialization and unequal participation are two elements that characterize privatized memory institutions and that may conflict with a democratic vision of social remembering. Privatized memory institutions also avoid institutional separation between the social function of cultural production and the social function of cultural preservation. The resulted outcome is that groups and sectors with dominant positions in contemporary media are able to reproduce, leverage and manipulate their social dominance from one generation to another. The power to remember, as well as the power to forget, is thus gradually being concentrated in clusters of commercial enterprises with very particular interests, beliefs, ideologies and preferences. I conclude with several reform proposals for deprivatizing networked memory institutions. As general matter of policy, reduced copyright protection is also likely to result in an equilibrium that strengthens the capacities of public-oriented memory institutions while reducing the incentives - and therefore the dominance - of commercial intermediaries entering this field. More specifically, I focus on two distinct types of reforms. One type of reform proposals focuses on ex-ante copyright privileges for networked memory institutions. The second type of reforms introduces my novel proposal to impose ex-post obligations on networked memory institutions. I argue that deprivatization of memory institutions requires also regulation that takes into account and moderates imbalanced proprietary regimes of networked memory institutions. Based on this argument, I offer a complementary set of reciprocal share-alike obligations that come on top of the general ex-ante privileges that memory institutions should benefit from.",2008,2019-11-03 21:28:49,2019-11-03 21:28:49,2016-12-02 19:24:23,71-149,,,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/B7EKFP6L/papers.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2', 'White Paper Research > A Time for Revision']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,"Université Paris Descartes,  France","['Université Paris Descartes,  France']","[['Université Paris Descartes,  France'], ['Université Paris Descartes,  France'], ['Université Paris Descartes,  France'], ['Université Paris Descartes,  France'], ['Université Paris Descartes,  France'], ['Université Paris Descartes,  France']]",6,10.1590/s1677-55382008000400015,,19.451164,,Systemic treatment for invasive bladder cancer: neoadjuvant chemotherapy and laparoscopic radical cystectomy,

NRDI2ST9,report,2014.0,"Margoni, Thomas","The Digitisation of Cultural Heritage: Originality, Derivative Works and (Non) Original Photographs",,,,,,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the legal consequences of the digitisation of cultural heritage institutions' archives and in particular to establish whether digitisation processes involve the originality required to trigger new copyright or copyright-related protection.As the European Commission and many MS reported, copyright and in particular ""photographers rights"" are cause of legal uncertainty during digitisation processes. A major role in this legally uncertain field is played by the standard of originality which is one of the main requirements for copyright protection. Only when a subject matter achieves the requested level of originality, it can be considered a work of authorship. Therefore, a first key issue analysed in this study is whether – and under which conditions – digitisation activities can be considered to be original enough as to constitute works (usually a photographic work) in their own right. A second element of uncertainty is connected with the type of work eventually created by acts of digitisation. If the process of digitisation of a (protected) work can be considered authorial, then the resulting work will be a derivative composed by two works: the original work digitally reproduced and the – probably – photographic work reproducing it. Finally, a third element of uncertainty is found in the protection afforded to ""other photographs"" by the last sentence of Art. 6 Term Directive and implemented in a handful of European countries.Accordingly, the paper is structured as follows: Part I is dedicated to the analysis of copyright law key concepts such as the originality standard, the definition of derivative works and the forms of protection available in cases of digital (or film-based) representations of objects (photographs). The second part of the study is devoted to a survey of a selection of EU Member States in an attempt to verify how the general concepts identified in Part I are applied by national legislatures and courts. The selected countries are Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands and the UK. The country analysis fulfils a double function: on the one hand it provides a specific overview of the national implementation of the solutions found at international and EU level. On the other hand, it constitutes the only possible approach in order to analyse the protection afforded by some MS to those ""other photographs"" (also called non original photographs or mere/simple photographs) provided for by the last sentence of Art. 6 Copyright Term Directive. Part III presents some conclusions and recommendations for cultural heritage institutions and for legislatures.",2014,2019-11-03 21:20:55,2019-11-03 21:20:55,2015-11-21 12:25:21,,,,,,,The Digitisation of Cultural Heritage,,,,,,,,Institute for Information Law (IViR),,,,,00000,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/MDHG29L3/papers.html,,,originality; cultural heritage; derivative works; EU copyright law; non original photographs; photographic works; right of adaptation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ID 2573104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2', 'White Paper Research > A Time for Revision > Clarifying Open']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.2139/ssrn.2573137,,99.74493,,"The Digitisation of Cultural Heritage Originality, Derivative Works and (Non) Original Photographs: Executive Summary",

Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to “decolonize our schools,” or use “decolonizing methods,” or, “decolonize student thinking”, turns decolonization into a metaphor. As important as their goals may be, social justice, critical methodologies, or approaches that decenter settler perspectives have objectives that may be incommensurable with decolonization. Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, non-white, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or “settler moves to innocence”, that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In this article, we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward “an ethic of incommensurability” that recognizes what is distinct and what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to unsettling themes within transnational/Third World decolonizations, abolition, and critical space-place pedagogies, which challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful potential alliances.",2012-09-08,2019-11-03 21:06:38,2019-11-03 21:06:38,2019-11-03 21:06:38,,,1,1.0,,,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c),,,,jps.library.utoronto.ca,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/R7JWY96V/18630.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/WAQAFIB6/Tuck and Yang - 2012 - Decolonization is not a metaphor.pdf,,,decolonization; decolonizing education; incommensurability; Indigenous land; settler colonialism; settler moves to innocence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Traditional knowledge, indigitization, and decolonization']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1080/13562517.2011.611870,,22.739674,,"Feedback-giving as social practice: teachers’ perspectives on feedback as institutional requirement, work and dialogue",

Policies can be important drivers for research institutions in the implementation of good data management practices. As Rans and Jones note (Rans and Jones 2013), “Policies provide clarity of purpose and may help in the framing of roles, responsibilities and requisite actions. They also legitimise making the case for investment”. However, policy development often tends to place the researchers in a passive position, while they are the ones managing research data on a daily basis. Therefore, at TU Delft, we have taken an alternative approach: a policy needs to go hand in hand with practice. The policy development was initiated by the Research Data Services at TU Delft Library, but as the process continued, other stakeholders, such as legal and IT departments, got involved. Finally, the faculty-based Data Stewards have played a key role in leading the consultations with the research community that led to the development of the faculty-specific policies. This allows for disciplinary differences to be reflected in the policies and to create a closer connection between policies and day-to-day research practice. Our primary intention was to keep researchers and research practices at the centre of our strategy for data management. We did not want to introduce and mandate requirements before adequate infrastructure and professional support were available to our research community and before our researchers were themselves willing to discuss formalisation of data management practices. This paper describes the key steps taken and the most important decisions made during the development of RDM policies at TU Delft.",2019-09-12,2019-11-03 20:27:25,2019-11-03 20:27:25,2019-11-03 20:27:25,45,,1,18.0,,,Policy Needs to Go Hand in Hand with Practice,,,,,,en,"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

It sets out the international (including regional) law currently governing the protection and safeguarding of cultural heritage in peace time, as well as international cultural policy-making. In addition to analyzing the relevant legal frameworks, it focuses on the broader policy and other contexts within which and in response to which this law has developed. Following this approach, attention is paid to: introducing international cultural heritage law and its place in international law generally; illicit excavation and the illegal trade in archaeological finds; protection of underwater cultural heritage; the relationship between cultural heritage and the environment; intangible aspects of heritage and their safeguarding; cultural heritage as traditional knowledge and creativity; regional approaches to protection; and human rights issues related to cultural heritage. In addition, newly-emerging topics and challenges are addressed, including the relationship between cultural heritage and sustainable development and the gender dynamics of cultural heritage. Providing both a perfect introduction to cultural heritage law and deeper reflection on its challenges, this book should be invaluable for students, scholars, and practitioners in the field.",2015-08-11,2019-10-24 13:08:36,2019-11-03 20:04:26,,,384.0,,,,,,Cultural Heritage Law and Policy,,,,Oxford University Press,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/3VYEEPJV/international-cultural-heritage-law-9780198723516.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],[],False,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198723516.003.0001,,56.483017,,Cultural Heritage Law,"Oxford, New York"

This is best in evidence from the IFLA’ Wikipedia and Libraries Opportunity Papers and the substantial growth and ubiquity of the #1lib1ref campaign. However, the relationships between cultural heritage organizations (known as GLAMs -- Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) and the Wikimedia communities working on Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and other Wikimedia projects, began in its relationships to Museums and Archives: partnerships like that with the British Museum in 2010 led to a collective effort to encourage GLAM organizations to contribute to and participate in Wikimedia Communities.Though early partnerships in the GLAM-Wiki space focused on batch uploads of digital content to Wikimedia Commons, embedding Wikimedia-designated experts called Wikipedians in Residence, and editing activities, like editathons, which write expert advised content into Wikipedia, in the last 6 years, the landscape in which partnership with cultural heritage institutions has shifted radically. Two major trends have developed in the Wikimedia community: a shift towards facilitating linked open data with Wikidata and the expansion of GLAM-Wiki projects to support institutions that not only have large digital capacity and funding, but also institutions with limited resources, collections focused on marginalized knowledge, and collections in parts of the world with limited digital expertise. In this transition, Wikimedia communities have become change agents in bringing both linked open data and open digital practices to institutions around the world. In this paper, we will explore how GLAM-Wiki tactics, opportunities and collaboration are changing the GLAM use of Wikimedia projects from being viewed as just a platform for exposing collection to a broader public audience, into a growing part of the heritage professional toolkit.",2018-09-15,2019-10-20 16:39:35,2019-10-20 16:39:35,2019-10-20 16:39:35,16-34,,3,9.0,,,Stepping Beyond Libraries,,,,,,en,"Copyright (c) 2018 Alexander D.

More specifically, the essay considers how constructivism is deployed as an opening to the inclusion of Indigenous epistemologies, yet also contains Indigenous epistemologies within a materialist and more specifically, Marxist and Hegelian philosophy. The author suggests that an implicit “shadow curriculum” has been articulated within the literature of Native culture-based curriculum which works against these forms of containment, but has rarely turned to Native American literary figures to elaborate the philosophical and theoretical differences they represent.",2011,2020-02-25 13:36:43,2020-02-25 13:36:43,2020-02-25 13:36:43,332-349,,3,41.0,,,Navigating the Problem of Inclusion as Enclosure in Native Culture-Based Education,,,,,,en,© 2011 by The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/BAABN3IH/j.1467-873X.2011.00552.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Traditional knowledge, indigitization, and decolonization']",['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1111/j.1467-873X.2011.00552.x,,exact,,Navigating the Problem of Inclusion as Enclosure in Native Culture-Based Education: Theorizing Shadow Curriculum,

To illustrate their answer, the contributors agreed to share the stages of their book-in-progress as it was constructed on the public web. To facilitate this innovative volume, editors Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access, and open peer review process to capture commentary from appointed experts and general readers. A customized WordPress plug-in allowed audiences to add page- and paragraph-level comments to the manuscript, transforming it into a socially networked text. The initial six-week proposal phase generated over 250 comments, and the subsequent eight-week public review of full drafts drew 942 additional comments from readers across different parts of the globe. The finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) if and how digital and emergent technologies have changed the historical profession.",2013,2020-02-25 12:57:23,2020-02-25 12:58:14,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Michigan Press,,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/53GRW4AY/nz806057k.html,,,Cultural Studies; Digital Projects; History:Historical Methods and Theory; Media Studies:New Media,"Dougherty, Jack; Nawrotzki, Kristen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['White Paper Research > Areas of Focus'],['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,0,10.1353/book.27633,,35.349003,,Writing History in the Digital Age,

Digital Humanities research is transforming how the Human record can be transmitted, shaped, understood, questioned and imagined and it has been ongoing for more than 70 years. However, we have no comprehensive histories of its research trajectory or its disciplinary development. The authors make a first contribution towards remedying this by uncovering, documenting, and analysing a number of the social, intellectual and creative processes that helped to shape this research from the 1950s until the present day.By taking an oral history approach, this book explores questions like, among others, researchers’ earliest memories of encountering computers and the factors that subsequently prompted them to use the computer in Humanities research.Computation and the Humanities will be an essential read for cultural and computing historians, digital humanists and those interested in developments like the digitisation of cultural heritage and artefacts.

WQG4ZXNK,journalArticle,2020.0,"Gebre, Engida H; Morales, Esteban","How ""accessible"" is open data? Analysis of content-related information and users' comments in open datasets",Information and Learning Sciences,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ILS-08-2019-0086/full/html,"This paper aims to examine the nature and sufficiency of descriptive information included in open datasets and the nature of comments and questions users write in relation to specific datasets. Open datasets are provided to facilitate civic engagement and government transparency. However, making the data available does not guarantee usage. This paper examined the nature of context-related information provided together with the datasets and identified the challenges users encounter while using the resources. Design/methodology/approach The authors extracted descriptive text provided together with (often at the top of) datasets (N = 216) and the nature of questions and comments users post in relation to the dataset. They then segmented text descriptions and user comments into “idea units” and applied open-coding with constant comparison method. This allowed them to come up with thematic issues that descriptions focus on and the challenges users encounter. Findings Results of the analysis revealed that context-related descriptions are limited and normative. Users are expected to figure out how to use the data. Analysis of user comments/questions revealed four areas of challenge they encounter: organization and accessibility of the data, clarity and completeness, usefulness and accuracy and language (spelling and grammar). Data providers can do more to address these issues. Research limitations/implications The purpose of the study is to understand the nature of open data provision and suggest ways of making open data more accessible to “non expert users”. As such, it is not focused on generalizing about open data provision in various countries as such provision may be different based on jurisdiction. Practical implications The study provides insight about ways of organizing open dataset that the resource can be accessible by the general public. It also provides suggestions about how open data providers could consider users' perspectives including providing continuous support. Originality/value Research on open data often focuses on technological, policy and political perspectives. Arguably, this is the first study on analysis of context-related information in open-datasets. Datasets do not “speak for themselves” because they require context for analysis and interpretation. Understanding the nature of context-related information in open dataset is original idea.",2020,2020-02-25 12:42:17,2020-02-25 12:43:45,,19-36,,1/2,121.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['*WORK IN', 'ADMIN > Paywall']","['ADMIN', '*WORK IN']",False,False,False,True,True,,,Error: No affiliations provided,4,10.1108/ils-08-2019-0086,,132.75153,,How “accessible” is open data?,

It argues that these five treaties have effectively prevented local communities, who bear the brunt of the costs associated with international heritage protection, from having a say in how their heritage is managed. The exclusion of local communities often alienates them not only from international decision-making processes but also from their cultural heritage itself, ultimately meaning that systems put in place for the protection of cultural heritage contribute to its disappearance in the long term.   International Heritage Law for Communities adds to existing literature by looking at these UNESCO treaties not as isolated regimes, but rather as belonging to a discursive continuum on cultural heritage. In doing so, the book focuses on themes that cut across the relevant UNESCO regimes like the use of expert rule in international heritage law, economics, the relationship between heritage and the environment, among others, rather than the regimes themselves. It uses this mechanism to highlight the blind spots and unintended consequences of UNESCO treaties and how choices made in their drafting have continuing and potentially negative impacts on how we think about and safeguard heritage.",2019-06-06,2019-11-24 13:45:57,2019-11-24 13:45:57,,,320.0,,,,,International Heritage Law for Communities,Cultural Heritage Law and Policy,,,,Oxford University Press,,,,,,Oxford University Press,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/E2PTZ4KV/international-heritage-law-for-communities-9780198843306.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Intangible cultural heritage']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1093/oso/9780198843306.001.0001,,92.65796,,International Heritage Law for Communities,"Oxford, New York"

Postcolonial digital humanities is one approach to uncovering and remedying inequalities in digital knowledge production, which is implicated in an information-age politics of knowledge. New Digital Worlds traces the formation of postcolonial studies and digital humanities as fields, identifying how they can intervene in knowledge production in the digital age. Roopika Risam examines the role of colonial violence in the development of digital archives and the possibilities of postcolonial digital archives for resisting this violence. Offering a reading of the colonialist dimensions of global organizations for digital humanities research, she explores efforts to decenter these institutions by emphasizing the local practices that subtend global formations and pedagogical approaches that support this decentering.

NJBPAHKQ,journalArticle,2015.0,"Cronin, Charles",3D Printing: Cultural Property as Intellectual Property,Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts,,,,,"Long before the onset of the now-emblematic quarrel between England and Greece over the Parthenon marbles, nations and tribes have squabbled over the extraterritorial transfer of objects of purported cultural significance. Over the past few decades, however, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of cultural property repatriation claims, mostly targeting U.S. collections. The value of cultural artifacts is generated largely by the intellectual expression they manifest.  Digital technologies make increasingly possible the creation of reproductions of even three-dimensional artifacts, which are indistinguishable from the originals.  This development challenges our attributing value to the “aura” of the original renderings of tangible cultural artifacts.  Stripped of their auras, the worth of these objects devolves to the sum of the value of the physical materials deployed in their creation, and that ascribed to the perceptible intellectual expression they contain.

AC9FX29Z,journalArticle,2018.0,"Sangwand, T-Kay",Preservation is Political: Enacting Contributive Justice and Decolonizing Transnational Archival Collaborations,"KULA: knowledge creation, dissemination, and preservation studies",,2398-4112,10.5334/kula.36,http://kula.uvic.ca/articles/10.5334/kula.36/,"This article contributes to critical archival studies discourse and builds upon the theoretical and practical work accomplished under the postcustodial rubric in order to propose an archival framework that is explicitly oriented in the service of justice. Global north/south postcustodial collaborations highlight the ethical and practical obligation of adopting an archival framework that accounts for expanded notions of stewardship and narrative agency. As an archivist based in US academic libraries who works primarily on transnational archival collaborations in the global south, I want to introduce the concept of contributive justice to these postcustodial transnational collaborations because it reframes the role of the partner organization in the global south and acknowledges the agency of all partners (Gomberg 2007). By drawing upon my experiences facilitating transnational archival partnerships between US academic libraries and institutions in Cuba, El Salvador, and Rwanda, I build upon Michelle Caswell’s (2017) suggested actions for dismantling white supremacy within US archives by offering concrete ways archivists can utilize a contributive justice framework to decolonize archival practices (i.e., appraisal, description, access) within transnational partnerships. By offering these examples, we can begin to both imagine and enact a more just and liberatory archival praxis. As Caswell states, ‘through the lens of liberatory archival imaginaries, our work … does not end with the limits of our collection policies, but rather, it is an ongoing process of conceptualizing what we want the future to look like’ (2014a: 51). The stakes are high in the shaping of our collective histories, and we all have the responsibility of envisioning and enacting liberatory archival futures.",2018-11-29,2019-11-20 11:49:38,2020-04-13 17:16:46,2019-11-20 11:49:38,10,,1,2.0,,,Preservation is Political,,,,,,en,"Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:    Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution License  that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.

The ambition is often to open up the Australian legal space. Here international law is looked to for inspiration; categories of property, environmental, intellectual property and cultural heritage law are forensically surveyed, in the hope that these may be imaginatively repositioned to make room for the ‘Other’ under domestic law. This chapter interrogates the distinction between space and place under Australian law as a major problem that needs addressing for reform initiatives to bear fruit. We are concerned with deconstructing the idea of legal space in abstract as if it is “an empty vessel existing prior to the matter which fills it”, and in questioning the priority afforded to space over and above attention to the importance of recognising the specificities of particular places in law.",2017,2019-11-23 14:42:03,2020-04-13 17:07:17,2019-11-23 14:42:03,,,,,,,"The Placelessness of Property, Intellectual Property and Cultural Heritage Law in the Australian Legal Landscape",,,,,UNSW Law Research Paper No. 17-22,en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/YAUTGRPA/papers.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/R8YHGJVH/SSRN-id2943752.pdf,,,Cultural heritage; cultural landscapes; environmentalism; Hindmarsh Island Bridge; legal geography; property; Uluru; world heritage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Traditional knowledge, indigitization, and decolonization']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,,,Error: Type not supported,,Error: Type not supported,,,

It encompasses discussion of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families (the Stolen Generations) and an attempt to reclaim a personal diary and sketchbooks toured as part of a retrospective exhibition about Aboriginal artist Trevor Nickolls. The article shows how institutional politics, curatorial practices and intellectual property concepts combine to free up information flows and authorise others to speak of, about and for Aboriginal peoples. At a time when our public institutions are seeking greater participation by Aboriginal people in curating collections, and historians and academics are very interested in using archival material, there needs to be a wider discussion about the potential harms that can arise from opening up archival access.",2016,2019-11-03 21:10:34,2020-04-13 17:03:54,2019-11-03 21:10:34,,,,3.0,,,"Speaking of Us, About Us and for Us",,,,,,en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/ABQ5GTM3/Bowrey - 2016 - Speaking of Us, About Us and for Us Telling Stori.pdf",,,copyright; archives; colonialism; cultural appropriation; Indigenous rights; stolen generations; Truth Commissions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Traditional knowledge, indigitization, and decolonization']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,"Kathy Bowrey, Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales, Australia.

International OE declarations (e.g. Cape Town Declaration, 2007; Paris Declaration, 2012; UNESCO-Recommendation, 2019) have called for an OE ethos to be embedded within wider education policy, as it is understood as a key spur to democratise access to quality education. Nowadays, a series of international initiatives are attempting to stimulate action on educational and scientific openness, including guidelines to foster sustainable policies. In some cases, nations and subnational governments have taken up the challenge of incorporating policy to enable open resources and practices into education policymaking agendas. What is less clear, and less straightforward to investigate, is the extent to which individual institutions are developing policies to support openness.  Our session at OER20, reported on the current state of OE policies internationally, based on the OE Policy Registry dataset. Through engagement with the data held in the Policy Registry it has been possible to collect and examine a wide range of policy documents and sketch some key features of the OE policy landscape. Further auditing of this dataset is needed, in order that the registry can be used effectively to support policy benchlearning by OE advocates, researchers and policymakers.  This session presented the initial findings of a research project conducted using this dataset, and additionally, inputs gained during a series of workshops designed to support OE policy co-creation. We presented key features of the OE Policy Registry to support  OE advocates seeking to support and enhance practice through policy  Policymakers at institutional and governmental levels Researchers interested in OE policy For these user groups, several different use-cases are addressed and presented: Policymakers can showcase and find good practice policy exemplars, which they can adapt and reuse within their context. OER advocates and advocacy networks can connect with each other, so that they can exchange experiences and cooperate in joint projects. Researchers can collect data on policy activities in different educational sectors and geographical areas, gaining a deeper understanding of the functioning of OE ecosystems and develop strategies for mainstreaming.",2020-04-02,2020-04-13 15:43:25,2020-04-13 15:43:25,2020-04-13 15:43:25,,,,,,,The Open Education policy registry,,,,,OE Policy Registry,eng,,,,,Zenodo,,DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3738418,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/ZHGVPL3Z/Havemann et al. - 2020 - The Open Education policy registry An open benchl.pdf,,,Open Education; Open Education Policies; Open Education Practices; Open Educational Resources; Open Policies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['ADMIN > New Resource Dump'],['ADMIN'],False,False,False,True,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,4,10.3402/rlt.v22.20889,,65.27654,,Questions of quality in repositories of open educational resources: a literature review,

The discussion has only intensified since the show opened on Broadway in August of that year. In September 2016, the musical's composer, lyricist, and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda; its director, Thomas Kail; and its historical consultant, Ron Chernow, were awarded the 2016 Records of Achievement Award from the National Archives Foundation, following the presentation of the Society of American Archivists' J. Franklin Jameson Archival Advocacy Award to Miranda and Chernow the previous summer. Other prizes have included the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and eleven Tony Awards. The popularity and acclaim of the musical, as well as its use of historical documents to tell its story, merit an examination from an archival perspective. How are records used and represented in Hamilton? Taking as a foundation (though not as a framework) the “iconography of archives” first outlined by Barbara Craig and James O'Toole and since updated by Lindsay Mattock and Eleanor Mattern, this article examines records' presence both onstage and in the narrative of Hamilton. Records are used as props and appear as subjects throughout the show's two acts. Records are also represented as historical evidence, providing the authority for the historically inspired story onstage. Yet, at the same time, Hamilton depicts the archival record as incomplete, asking audiences to reflect on the constructed nature of “who lives, who dies, who tells your story.”",2017-03-01,2020-04-13 11:10:58,2020-04-13 11:10:58,2020-04-13 11:10:58,53-81,,1,80.0,,The American Archivist,"“Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”",,,,,,,,,,,americanarchivist.org (Atypon),,Publisher: Society of American Archivists,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/UFC4CEVC/0360-9081.80.1.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/ZVP7LSMZ/Madison - 2017 - “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”The Us.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.17723/0360-9081.80.1.53,,exact,,"“Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”:The Use and Representation of Records in Hamilton: An American Musical",

Art historians, artists, and anyone who wants to use the images of others will find themselves awash in byzantine legal terms, constantly evolving copyright law, varying interpretations by museums and estates, and despair over the complexity of the whole situation. Here, on a white—not a high—horse, Susan Bielstein offers her decades of experience as an editor working with illustrated books. In doing so, she unsnarls the threads of permissions that have ensnared scholars, critics, and artists for years.Organized as a series of “takes” that range from short sidebars to extended discussions, Permissions, A Survival Guide explores intellectual property law as it pertains to visual imagery. How can you determine whether an artwork is copyrighted? How do you procure a high-quality reproduction of an image? What does “fair use” really mean? Is it ever legitimate to use the work of an artist without permission? Bielstein discusses the many uncertainties that plague writers who work with images in this highly visual age, and she does so based on her years navigating precisely these issues. As an editor who has hired a photographer to shoot an incredibly obscure work in the Italian mountains (a plan that backfired hilariously), who has tried to reason with artists' estates in languages she doesn't speak, and who has spent her time in the archival trenches, she offers a snappy and humane guide to this difficult terrain.Filled with anecdotes, asides, and real courage, Permissions, A Survival Guide is a unique handbook that anyone working in the visual arts will find invaluable, if not indispensable.",2006-06-23,2020-04-12 13:33:12,2020-04-12 13:33:12,,,188.0,,,,,"Permissions, A Survival Guide",,,,,University Of Chicago Press,English,,,,,Amazon,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Permissions-Survival-Guide-Intellectual-Propery/dp/0226046389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2']",['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.7208/chicago/9780226046396.001.0001,,109.895096,,"Permissions, A Survival Guide",Chicago

Digital imaging capabilities represent a significant development in the academic study of art, and they enhance the availability of art images to the public at large.  The possible uses of these images are likewise broad.  Many conditions of use, however, are defined by copyright law or by license agreements imposed by museums and libraries that attempt to circumscribe allowable uses.  Often, these terms and conditions will mean that an online image is not truly available for many purposes, including publication in the context of research or simple aesthetic enjoyment.  Not only do these terms and conditions restrict uses, they also have dubious legal standing after the Bridgeman case.  This chapter examines the legal premises behind claiming copyright in art images and the ability of museums to impose license restrictions on their use.This paper is one outcome of a study of museum licensing practices funded by The Samuel H. Kress Foundation.  It is principally an introduction to the relevant law in the United States and a survey of examples of museum licenses.  The project is in its early stages, with the expectation that later studies will expand on this introduction and provide greater analysis of the legal complications of copyright, the public domain, and the reach of license agreements as a means for controlling the use of artwork and potentially any other works, whether or not they fall within the scope of copyright protection.This chapter was prepared for presentation at the Annual Congress of the International Association for the Advancement of Teaching and Research in Intellectual Property (ATRIP), held in Vilnius, Lithuania on 13-16 September 2009.  The co-author with Kenneth D. Crews is Melissa A. Brown, now the Scholarly Communications Librarian at New York University.

EGCR4LXU,journalArticle,2012.0,"Crews, Kenneth D.",Museum Policies and Art Images: Conflicting Objectives and Copyright Overreaching,"Fordham Intellectual Property, Media and Entertainment Law Journal",,,,https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1518&context=iplj,"Museums face steady demand for images of artworks from their collections, and they typically provide a service of making and delivering high-resolution images of art.  The images are often intellectually essential for scholarly study and teaching, and they are sometimes economically valuable for production of the coffee mugs and note cards sold in museum shops and elsewhere.  Though the law is unclear regarding copyright protection afforded to such images, many museum policies and licenses encumber the use of art images with contractual terms and license restrictions often aimed at raising revenue or protecting the integrity of the art.  This article explores the extent to which museums have strained the limits of copyright claims and indeed have restructured concepts of ownership and control in ways that curtail the availability and use of art images far beyond anything that may be grounded in the law.  This article examines the relevant copyright law applicable to the making and use of reproductions of art images, and it identifies the challenging pressures that museums face as they strive to make policies in the context of law but that also serve the multiple competing interests coming to bear on officials and decision makers inside museums.  The article analyzes selected policies from major museums and provides an original construct of forms of “overreaching” that often appear in written standards offered by museums for the use of images.  The analysis of policies also demonstrates that museums have choices in the shaping of institutional policies, and that breaking away from familiar policy terms can sometimes better serve institutional and public interests.",2012,2019-10-24 20:27:05,2020-04-12 10:43:16,,795-834,,4,22.0,,,Museum Policies and Art Images,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/AV52VAH4/papers.html,,,copyright; museums; fair use; policies; art,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2', 'White Paper Research > A Short History of the Open GLAM Movement > Barriers to Open', 'White Paper Research > A Time for Revision']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,4,10.4337/9780857931542.00021,,65.36764,,Control of Museum Art Images: The Reach and Limits of Copyright and Licensing,

Why?  This paper presents new data on how copyright stifles the reappearance of works.  First, a random sample of more than 2000 new books for sale on Amazon.com is analyzed along with a random sample of almost 2000 songs available on new DVD’s.  Copyright status correlates highly with absence from the Amazon shelf.  Together with publishing business models, copyright law seems to deter distribution and diminish access. Further analysis of eBook markets, used books on Abebooks.com, and the Chicago Public library collection suggests that no alternative marketplace for out-of-print books has yet developed.  Data from iTunes and YouTube, however, tell a different story for older hit songs.  The much wider availability of old music in digital form may be explained by the differing holdings in two important cases Boosey & Hawkes v. Disney (music) and Random House v.

The purpose of this paper is to examine OpenGLAM from the perspective of end users, identifying barriers for commercial and non-commercial reuse of openly licensed art images. / Design/methodology/approach: Following a review of the literature, the authors scope out how end users can discover institutions participating in OpenGLAM, and use case studies to examine the process they must follow to find, obtain and reuse openly licensed images from three art museums. / Findings: Academic literature has so far focussed on examining the risks and benefits of participation from an institutional perspective, with little done to assess OpenGLAM from the end users’ standpoint. The authors reveal that end users have to overcome a series of barriers to find, obtain and reuse open images. The three main barriers relate to image quality, image tracking and the difficulty of distinguishing open images from those that are bound by copyright. / Research limitations/implications: This study focusses solely on the examination of art museums and galleries. Libraries, archives and also other types of OpenGLAM museums (e.g. archaeological) stretch beyond the scope of this paper. / Practical implications: The authors identify practical barriers of commercial and non-commercial reuse of open images, outlining areas of improvement for participant institutions. / Originality/value: The authors contribute to the understudied field of research examining OpenGLAM from the end users’ perspective, outlining recommendations for end users, as well as for museums and galleries.",2020,2020-04-11 13:45:12,2020-04-11 13:47:13,2020-04-11 13:45:12,1-26,,1,76.0,,,How open is OpenGLAM?,,,,,,eng,open,,,,discovery.ucl.ac.uk,,Number: 1,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/7SDI59GF/10088438.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/8C52N9XP/Valeonti et al. - 2020 - How open is OpenGLAM Identifying barriers to comm.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,6,10.1108/jd-06-2019-0109,,171.55144,,How open is OpenGLAM?

To that end it considers international IP and environment treaties (notably the TRIPS Agreement, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes and its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, and the Aarhus Convention) and the extent to which their objectives can and do intersect or conflict. Particular reference is made to discussions at the TRIPS Council and to the activities of WIPO Green. It explores possible ways to increase the role of IP in addressing climate change issues, including limiting the availability of patents, fast-tracking certain patent applications, and promoting IP exploitation models based on sharing rather than control. Finally, it explores the benefits to be gained in developing the relationship between IP and climate change by looking more widely, to human rights and competition laws.",2018,2020-03-14 10:33:04,2020-03-14 10:36:29,2020-03-14 10:33:04,,,,,,,,,,,,Oxford University Press,en,,,,,www.oxfordhandbooks.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/QX4VISQM/oxfordhb-9780198758457-e-34.html,,,,"Dreyfuss, Rochelle; Pila, Justine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Sustainability (environmental, practical, etc.)']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198758457.013.34,,70.03233,,Intellectual Property and Climate Change,

2UW5UE5K,journalArticle,2006.0,"Chon, Margaret",Intellectual Property and the Development Divide,Cardozo Law Review,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=894162,"This Article attempts to map the challenges raised by recent encounters between intellectual property and development.  It proposes a normative principle of global intellectual property - one that is responsive to development paradigms that have moved far beyond simple utilitarian measures of social welfare.  Recent insights from the field of development economics suggest strongly that intellectual property should include a substantive equality principle, measuring its welfare-generating outcomes not only by economic growth but also by distributional effects.  A new principle of substantive equality is a necessary corollary to the formal equality principles of national treatment and minimum standards that are now imposed on virtually all countries regardless of their level of development.  Indeed this principle is arguably the very core of a human development-driven concept of development, a term that is highly indeterminate but lately used by many developing countries to express an equality concern within various global intellectual property regimes such as the WTO and WIPO.  This proposed principle of substantive intellectual property equality would be analogous to strict scrutiny review in the judicial context of U.S. constitutional law.  It would be foundational to any form of intellectual property decision making.  Simply put, a decision maker would accord much less deference and exercise much more skepticism towards the proposed government action (in this case, the regulatory intervention by the state in the form of the grant of intellectual property protection, or the withholding of an exception or limitation to an intellectual property grant) when a knowledge good that affects basic human development capabilities, such as basic education or health care, is implicated.  Certain foundational capacities, whether viewed as the sum of individual capabilities in knowledge or as national capacities in production of knowledge goods, should guide application and creation of intellectual property norms. This proposed substantive equality principle would match intellectual property's innovation mandate to the actual local conditions and concerns of developing countries seeking to join the global knowledge economy.  It has taken on new urgency and significance given the recent agreement by WIPO member states to forward recommendations of The New WIPO Development Agenda to the General Assembly in the fall 2007.",2006,2020-04-21 05:43:35,2020-04-21 05:44:29,2020-04-21 05:43:35,2821-2912,,6,27.0,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/JPKINWUS/Chon - 2006 - Intellectual Property and the Development Divide.pdf,,,Development; Development Agenda; Globalization; Intellectual Property,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.2202/1565-3404.1271,,43.758705,,Global Intellectual Property Governance (Under Construction),

This critique is based firstly on data about the composition of various government organs, institutions and the principal journals in the field, and secondly on a general reflection on the cultural, political and linguistic bias of digital standards, protocols and interfaces. These reflections suggest that DH is not only a discipline and an academic discourse dominated materially by an Anglo-American élite and intellectually by a mono-cultural view, but also that it lacks a theoretical model for reflecting critically on its own instruments. I conclude by proposing the elaboration of a different model of DH, based on the concept of knowledge as a commons and the cultivation of cultural margins, as opposed to its present obsession with large-scale digitization projects and ""archiving fever,"" that leads to an increase in our dependency on the products of private industry and, of course, on their funding.",2012,2020-04-20 11:10:45,2020-04-20 11:10:45,2020-04-20 11:10:45,59-76,,3 (141),37.0,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,JSTOR,,"Publisher: GESIS - Leibniz-Institute for the Social Sciences, Center for Historical Social Research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1163/1569206041551663,,31.798573,,Towards a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism,

Previous discussions of cultural heritage and digital technology have left the subject largely unmapped in terms of critical theory; the essays in this volume offer this long-missing perspective on the challenges of using digital media in the research, preservation, management, interpretation, and representation of cultural heritage. The contributors—scholars and practitioners from a range of relevant disciplines—ground theory in practice, considering how digital technology might be used to transform institutional cultures, methods, and relationships with audiences. The contributors examine the relationship between material and digital objects in collections of art and indigenous artifacts; the implications of digital technology for knowledge creation, documentation, and the concept of authority; and the possibilities for ""virtual cultural heritage""—the preservation and interpretation of cultural and natural heritage through real-time, immersive, and interactive techniques.The essays in Theorizing Digital Cultural Heritage will serve as a resource for professionals, academics, and students in all fields of cultural heritage, including museums, libraries, galleries, archives, and archaeology, as well as those in education and information technology.

These biases threaten to overshadow AI’s technological gains and potential benefits. While legal and computer science scholars have analyzed many sources of bias, including the unexamined assumptions of its often-homogenous creators, flawed algorithms, and incomplete datasets, the role of the law itself has been largely ignored. Yet just as code and culture play significant roles in how AI agents learn about and act in the world, so too do the laws that govern them.

While previous work has investigated the demographic diversity of museum staffs and visitors, the diversity of artists in their collections has remained unreported. We conduct the first large-scale study of artist diversity in museums. By scraping the public online catalogs of 18 major U.S. museums, deploying a sample of 10,000 artist records comprising over 9,000 unique artists to crowdsourcing, and analyzing 45,000 responses, we infer artist genders, ethnicities, geographic origins, and birth decades. Our results are threefold. First, we provide estimates of gender and ethnic diversity at each museum, and overall, we find that 85% of artists are white and 87% are men. Second, we identify museums that are outliers, having significantly higher or lower representation of certain demographic groups than the rest of the pool. Third, we find that the relationship between museum collection mission and artist diversity is weak, suggesting that a museum wishing to increase diversity might do so without changing its emphases on specific time periods and regions. Our methodology can be used to broadly and efficiently assess diversity in other fields.",2019-03-20,2020-04-17 15:24:48,2020-04-17 15:26:40,2020-04-17 15:24:48,,,3,14.0,,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,en,,,,,PLoS Journals,,Publisher: Public Library of Science,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/A5AX9B5D/article.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/C6VSZRKF/Topaz et al. - 2019 - Diversity of artists in major U.S. museums.pdf,,,Internet; Census; Ethnicities; Geoinformatics; Museum collections; North America; Regional geography; Surveys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,18,10.1371/journal.pone.0212852,,exact,,Diversity of artists in major U.S. museums,

Authors analyzed whether these policies reflect copyright law or went beyond it, unnecessarily restricting the use of materials or imposing fees where rights are in question.

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals – both employed and independent – across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their business model with an unknown end. By March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new creative works which had been inspired by the event. Many individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, financial stimulus from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.",2020-04-14,2020-04-14 16:51:16,2020-04-14 16:51:16,2020-04-14 16:51:16,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,Wikipedia,,Page Version ID: 950934686,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/3ECG4YXM/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],[],False,False,False,False,False,,,,,Error: Type not supported,,Error: Type not supported,,,

JAT2UYJ2,book,2012.0,"Abbate, Janet",Recoding Gender,,,,,https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender,"The untold history of women and computing: how pioneering women succeeded in a field shaped by gender biases.                 Today, women earn a relatively low percentage of computer science degrees and hold proportionately few technical computing jobs. Meanwhile, the stereotype of the male “computer geek” seems to be everywhere in popular culture. Few people know that women were a significant presence in the early decades of computing in both the United States and Britain. Indeed, programming in postwar years was considered woman's work (perhaps in contrast to the more manly task of building the computers themselves). In Recoding Gender, Janet Abbate explores the untold history of women in computer science and programming from the Second World War to the late twentieth century. Demonstrating how gender has shaped the culture of computing, she offers a valuable historical perspective on today's concerns over women's underrepresentation in the field.Abbate describes the experiences of women who worked with the earliest electronic digital computers: Colossus, the wartime codebreaking computer at Bletchley Park outside London, and the American ENIAC, developed to calculate ballistics. She examines postwar methods for recruiting programmers, and the 1960s redefinition of programming as the more masculine “software engineering.” She describes the social and business innovations of two early software entrepreneurs, Elsie Shutt and Stephanie Shirley; and she examines the career paths of women in academic computer science.Abbate's account of the bold and creative strategies of women who loved computing work, excelled at it, and forged successful careers will provide inspiration for those working to change gendered computing culture.",2012,2020-02-25 18:17:47,2020-02-26 15:29:43,2020-02-25 18:17:47,,,,,,,,,,,,The MIT Press,en,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/DYDXYS9M/recoding-gender.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['White Paper Research > Areas of Focus'],['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.7551/mitpress/9014.001.0001,,50.336235,,Recoding Gender,

In 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age. In Programmed Inequality, Mar Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer user—the civil service and sprawling public sector—to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy. Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.",2018,2020-02-25 18:14:49,2020-02-25 18:15:37,2020-02-25 18:14:49,,,,,,,,,,,,The MIT Press,en,,,,,,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/MU8LVYQ9/programmed-inequality.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['White Paper Research > A Time for Revision'],['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1109/mc.2018.3971355,,27.645351,,When Winning Is Losing: Why the Nation that Invented the Computer Lost Its Lead,

W7VK2CNC,report,2019.0,"Buccafusco, Christopher",Disability and Design,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3497902,"When scholars contemplate the legal tools available to policymakers for encouraging innovation, they primarily think about patents. If they are keeping up with the most recent literature, they may also consider grants, prizes, and taxes as means to increase the supply of innovation. But the innovation policy toolkit is substantially deeper than that. To demonstrate its depth, this Article explores the evolution of designs that help people with disabilities access the world around them. From artificial limbs to the modern wheelchair and the reshaping of the built environment, a variety of legal doctrines have influenced, for better and for worse, the pace and direction of innovation for accessible design.This Article argues that two of the most important drivers of innovation for accessible design have been social welfare laws and antidiscrimination laws. Both were responsible, in part, for the revolution in accessibility that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century. Unlike standard innovation incentives, however, these laws operate on the “demand side.” Social welfare laws and antidiscrimination laws increase the ability and willingness of parties to pay for accessible technology, ultimately leading to greater supply. But in doing so, these laws generate a different distribution of the costs and benefits of innovation. They also produce their own sets of innovation distortions by allowing third parties to make decisions about the designs that people with disabilities have to use.  The law can promote innovation, and it can hinder it. The law’s relationship to the wheelchair, the most important accessibility innovation of the twentieth century, produced both results. Policymakers have choices about which legal incentives doctrines they can use and how they can use them. This Article evaluates those tools, and it provides guidelines for their use to encourage accessible technology in particular and innovation generally.",2019-12-03,2020-02-25 18:10:37,2020-02-25 18:10:37,2020-02-25 18:10:37,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Science Research Network,en,,SSRN Scholarly Paper,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/F7JNKQ86/papers.html,,,disability; accommodation; ADA; antitrust; civil rights; design; disabled; innovation; institution; IP; patent; prostheses; social welfare; tort; user,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ID 3497902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Accessibility'],['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.2139/ssrn.3497902,,31.878738,,Incentivizing Accessible Design,"Rochester, NY"

A principal component of these collections is an assemblage of several thousand artefacts from western Africa that were transported to institutions in northwest England between 1894 and 1916 by the Liverpool steam ship engineer Arnold Ridyard. While Ridyard's collecting efforts can be seen to have been shaped by the steamers' dynamic capacity to connect widely separated people and places, his Methodist credentials were fundamental in determining the profile of his African networks, because they meant that he was not part of official colonial authority in West Africa. Kingdon's study uncovers the identities of many of Ridyard's numerous West African collaborators and discusses their interests and predicaments under the colonial dispensation. Against this background account, their agendas are examined with reference to surviving narratives that accompanied their donations and within the context of broader processes of trans-imperial exchange, through which they forged new identities and statuses for themselves and attempted to counter expressions of British cultural imperialism in the region. The study concludes with a discussion of the competing meanings assigned to the Ridyard assemblage by the Liverpool Museum and examines the ways in which its re-contextualization in museum contexts helped to efface signs of the energies and narratives behind its creation.""--Publisher's website.",2019,2020-02-25 17:43:13,2020-02-25 17:43:13,,,,,,,,Ethnographic collecting and African agency in early colonial West Africa,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1089016320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['White Paper Research > Areas of Focus > Traditional knowledge, indigitization, and decolonization']",['White Paper Research'],False,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,22,10.5040/9781501337956,,78.62449,,Ethnographic Collecting and African Agency in Early Colonial West Africa,

Although entering and accessing catalogue information now relies on keyboards rather than inkwells, the earliest systems continue to influence our understanding of objects. Among the most influential of the early systems was that of the Smithsonian's United States National Museum (USNM), with its first anthropological catalogue entry dating to 1859. Analysis of the material culture of the ubiquitous catalogue books of American museums both before and after the establishment of the USNM system reveals its wide and lasting impact. This system normalized certain fields as essential and disciplined data accordingly, resisting alternate ideas about information offered by donors and by later developments in anthropology.

LDTEWQ95,journalArticle,2019.0,"Flynn, Jacob; Giblin, Rebecca; Petitjean, Francois","What Happens When Books Enter the Public Domain? Testing Copyright’s Underuse Hypothesis Across Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada",University of New South Wales Law Journal,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3401684,"The United States (‘US’) extended most copyright terms by 20 years in 1998, and has since exported that extension via ‘free trade’ agreements to countries including Australia and Canada. A key justification for the longer term was the claim that exclusive rights are necessary to encourage publishers to invest in making older works available — and that, unless such rights were granted, they would go underused. This study empirically tests this ‘underuse hypothesis’ by investigating the relative availability of ebooks to public libraries across Australia, New Zealand, the US and Canada. We find that books are actually less available where they are under copyright than where they are in the public domain, and that commercial publishers seem undeterred from investing in works even where others are competing to supply the same titles. We also find that exclusive rights do not appear to trigger investment in works that have low commercial demand, with books from 59% of the ‘culturally valuable’ authors we sampled unavailable in any jurisdiction, regardless of copyright status. This provides new evidence of how even the shortest copyright terms can outlast works’ commercial value, even where cultural value remains. Further, we find that works are priced much higher where they are under copyright than where they in the public domain, and these differences typically far exceed what would be paid to authors or their heirs. Thus, one effect of extending copyrights from life + 50 to life + 70 is that libraries are obliged to pay higher prices in exchange for worse access.This is the first published study to test the underuse hypothesis outside the US, and the first to analyse comparative availability of identical works across jurisdictions where their copyright status differs. It adds to the evidence that the underuse hypothesis is not borne out by real world practice. Nonetheless, countries are still being obliged to enact extended terms as a cost of trade access. We argue that such nations should explore alternative ways of dividing up those rights to better achieve copyright’s fundamental aims of rewarding authors and promoting widespread access to knowledge and culture.",2019,2020-05-19 14:53:20,2020-05-19 14:54:27,2020-05-19 14:53:20,1215-1253,,4,42.0,,,What Happens When Books Enter the Public Domain?,,,,,,en,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/U9TJTKUQ/papers.html,,,theory; copyright; public domain; underuse; underuse hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.7790/tja.v62i4.310,,41.748833,,On the (new) New Zealand graduated response law (and why it’s unlikely to achieve its aims),

XVCW66JG,book,1998.0,"Coombe, Rosemary J.","The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties: Authorship, Appropriation, and the Law",,978-0-8223-2119-4,,,,"Logos, trademarks, national insignia, brand names, celebrity images, design patents, and advertising texts are vibrant signs in a consumer culture governed by a regime of intellectual property laws. In The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties, professor of law and cultural anthropologist Rosemary J. Coombe brings an illuminating ethnographic approach to an analysis of authorship and the role law plays in shaping the various meanings that animate these protected properties in the public sphere.Although such artifacts are ubiquitous in contemporary culture, little attention has been paid to the impact of intellectual property law in everyday life or to how ownership of specific intellectual properties is determined and exercised. Drawing on a wide range of cases, disputes, and local struggles, Coombe examines these issues and dismantles the legal assumption that the meaning and value of a text or image is produced exclusively by an individual author or that authorship has a single point of origin. In the process, she examines controversies that include the service of turbanned Sikhs in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the use of the term Olympic in reference to the proposed gay Olympic Games. Other chapters discuss the appropriation of such celebrity images as the Marx brothers, Judy Garland, Dolly Parton, James Dean, and Luke Skywalker; the conflict over team names such as the Washington Redskins; and the opposition of indigenous peoples to stereotypical Native American insignia proffered by the entertainment industry. Ultimately, she makes a case for redefining the political in commodified cultural environments.Significant for its insights into the political significance of current intellectual property law, this book also provides new perspectives on debates in cultural anthropology, cultural studies, and political theory. It will therefore interest both a wide scholarly and a general audience.",1998-10-13,2020-05-04 14:25:28,2020-05-04 14:56:39,,,480.0,,,,,The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties,,,,,Duke University Press,English,,,,,,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Life-Intellectual-Properties-Post-Contemporary/dp/082232119X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.2307/j.ctv11sn021,,86.79372,,The Cultural Life of Intellectual Properties,Durham

This effect has been produced by certain aspects of copyright law itself allied with aspects of behaviour in the global market for “cultural goods and services”. The chapter analyses the extent to which these fettering effects have been exacerbated by other WTO agreements.

It sounds grandiloquent to call it ""the enclosure of the intangible commons of the mind,"" but in a very real sense that is just what it is. True, the new state-created property rights may be ""intellectual"" rather than ""real,"" but once again things that were formerly thought of as either common property or uncommodifiable are being covered with new, or newly extended, property rights. In this article, I try to develop the vocabulary and the analytic tools necessary to turn the tide of enclosure. I offer an historical sketch of various types of skepticism about intellectual property, from the antimonopolist criticisms of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution, through the emergence of affirmative arguments for the public domain, to the use of the language of the commons to defend the possibility of distributed methods of non-proprietary production. In many ways, it turns out, concepts of the public domain show the same variation in assumptions, and the same analytic differences, as the concept of property itself. I conclude by arguing that, for a number of reasons, the appropriate model for the change in thinking which I argue for comes from the history of the environmental movement. The invention of the concept of ""the environment"" pulls together a string of otherwise disconnected issues, offers analytical insight into the blindness implicit in prior ways of thinking, and leads to perception of common interest where none was seen before. Like the environment, the public domain must be ""invented"" before it is saved. Like the environment, like ""nature,"" the public domain turns out to be a concept that is considerably more slippery than many of us realize. And, like the environment, the public domain nevertheless turns out to be useful, perhaps even necessary.",2003,2020-04-20 17:47:20,2020-05-04 12:12:31,2017-10-18 08:39:02,33-74,,,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,papers.ssrn.com,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/MMUIK7HH/Boyle - The Second Enclosure Movement.pdf,,,public domain; intellectual property; History of Copyright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 1'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.4324/9781315095400-3,,64.24109,,The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain,

Managing Economic Challenges,,978-1-932326-02-4,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED482236,"In September 2002, the Council on Library and Information Re-sources (CLIR) commissioned a survey of North American-based digital cultural heritage initiatives (DCHIs). The purpose of the survey was to identify the scope, financing, organizational structure, and sustainability of DCHIs. To gain a funder's perspective on these initiatives, the survey also included a few public and private funding organizations that support projects with a digital cultural heritage component. Thirty-three organization or projects and five funding agencies or foundations were included in the survey. The findings outlined throughout this report identify concerns about the current status and tenuous state of many digital cultural initiatives. These findings, in concert with the recommendations  proposed, offer a blueprint for those exploring appropriate strategies to support and strengthen digital cultural initiatives. The number and diversity of issues that affect DCHIs and jeopardize their future warrant a coordinated and consensus-driven approach to the problem. The report consists of five parts: background; review of Digital Cultural Heritage Initiatives; review of funders of Digital Cultural Heritage Initiatives; recommendations; and summary. Appendixes include a list of participating organizations and contacts; CLIR survey for DCHIs; CLIR survey for organizations funding DCHIs.

The economic value of cultural assets is defined as the extent to which they generate benefits for society. The aim of this article is to shed light on the valuation of GLAMUR infrastructures and why, and then to valuate the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (GMB). In fact, the author of this paper argues that economic valuation through an estimate of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) (e.g. contingent valuation), is clearly an insufficient method for valuating a GLAMUR. One possible accurate method could be to calculate the Discounting of Cash-flows (DCF), followed by the discounting of the WTP estimates.",2010-04-01,2020-04-26 10:25:07,2020-04-26 10:25:07,2020-04-26 10:25:07,155-162,,2,11.0,,Journal of Cultural Heritage,Valuing museums as economic engines,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/RZNYH38N/S1296207409001095.html,,,Cultural heritage; Discounting cash-flows; Economic valuation; Museums as economic engines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],[],False,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.1016/j.culher.2009.06.001,,exact,,Valuing museums as economic engines: Willingness to pay or discounting of cash-flows?,

Within this framework of critical inquiry, this paper discusses the mechanisms of canon-formation in the context of the web as the new laboratory of cultural production. It is argued that the main dynamics observed can be elucidated under the form of a triad: hypercanonization, socialdecanonization, and transcanonization. These three processes operate simultaneously interlaced and unfold in dialectical tension between the rise of the new (practices, actors, values, ideas), and the maintenance of the old (those structures that already exist). This paper delves into the paths through which such interlace dynamics and tension might reshape the principles by which canonicity develops, as well as poses open questions about the challenges facing us, which should be discussed in further studies and approaches to the problem.",2018-06,2020-04-22 11:35:55,2020-04-22 11:35:55,2020-04-22 11:35:55,25,,2,2.0,,,"Canon, Value, and Cultural Heritage",,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/5L22NNBE/htm.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/748P33B3/Rodríguez-Ortega - 2018 - Canon, Value, and Cultural Heritage New Processes.pdf",,,cultural heritage; canon; Digital Art History; digital humanities; postdigital; value assignment processes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.3390/mti2020025,,exact,,"Canon, Value, and Cultural Heritage: New Processes of Assigning Value in the Postdigital Realm",

Including interviews with pioneering curators such as Okwui Enwezor, Linda Nochlin, Jean-Hubert Martin, and Nan Goldin, this volume is both an invaluable source of practical information for those who understand that institutions must be a driving force in this area and a vital source of inspiration for today?s expanding new generation of curators.",2018,2020-06-15 13:03:56,2020-06-15 13:03:56,,,,,,,,Curatorial activism,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1028019132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2', '**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3']",['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.4324/9780429496059-16,,30.468111,,Time Will Tell,

Through two case studies, this article explores the use of crowd-sourcing in order to develop digital tools that amplify women and provide them with a firmer online identity. The first, Wikipedia.org, is already entrenched in the popular research realm, and the second, WOAH (Women of Ancient History), is currently being developed as a reference tool. Wikipedia.org is the most influential source of knowledge in the world, but it has a stubborn gender bias against women. This distortion is particularly evident in the field of classics, where prior to 2017 only 7% of biographies of classicists featured women. Here, ‘classics’ is an inclusive term, and is broadly conceived to include the field of Late Antiquity. This short article details how the Women’s Classical Committee (UK)’s Wikipedia editing initiative, #WCCWiki, and the development of WOAH, have successfully increased the visibility of women online. Consequently, it offers a model to mobilize change with few physical or financial resources, but rather facilitated by digital tools and social media. Through digital feminist activism, there is the potential to reverse the gender skew of classicists online and in the public discourse, while also creating an inclusive space that is professional, proactive, and accessible to all.",2019-07-03,2020-06-15 12:50:00,2020-06-15 12:50:00,2020-06-15 12:50:00,4-16,,1,3.0,,,,,,,,,en-US,,,,,hcommons.org,,Publisher: University of California Press,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/MK3XKUPE/hc23429.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/IKTF74S9/Bond y Leonard - 2019 - Advancing Feminism Online.

Alison Adam admirably fills the large gap in science and technology studies by showing us that gender bias is inscribed in AI-based computer systems. Her treatment of feminist epistemology, focusing on the ideas of the knowing subject, the nature of knowledge, rationality and language, are bound to make a significant and powerful contribution to AI studies. Drawing from theories by Donna Haraway and Sherry Turkle, and using tools of feminist epistemology, Adam provides a sustained critique of AI which interestingly re-enforces many of the traditional criticisms of the AI project.

While altering technology use can reduce the impact of digital preservation practices, this alone is not a strategy for sustainable practice. Moving toward environmentally sustainable digital preservation requires critically examining the motivations and assumptions that shape current practice. Building on Goldman's challenge to current practices for digital authenticity and using Ehrenfeld's sustainability framework, we propose explicitly integrating environmental sustainability into digital preservation practice by shifting cultural heritage professionals' paradigm of appraisal, permanence, and availability of digital content. The article is organized in four parts. First, we review the literature for differing uses of the term “sustainability” in the cultural heritage field: financial, staffing, and environmental. Second, we examine the negative environmental effects of ICT throughout the full life cycle of its components to fill a gap in the cultural heritage literature, which primarily focuses on the electricity use of ICT. Next, we offer suggestions for reducing digital preservation's negative environmental impacts through altered technology use as a stopgap measure. Finally, we call for a paradigm shift in digital preservation practice in the areas of appraisal, permanence, and availability. For each area, we propose a model for sustainable practice, providing a framework for sustainable choices moving forward.",2019-03-01,2020-02-25 17:45:29,2020-06-09 22:50:55,2020-02-25 17:45:29,165-206,,1,82.0,,The American Archivist,,,,,,,,,,,,americanarchivist.org (Atypon),,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/DHGGNA4Y/Pendergrass et al. - 2019 - Toward Environmentally Sustainable Digital Preserv.pdf; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/7BG3ALEB/0360-9081-82.1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3', 'White Paper Research > Areas of Focus']","['White Paper Research', '**CITED']",True,True,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,8,10.17723/0360-9081-82.1.165,,exact,,Toward Environmentally Sustainable Digital Preservation,

This journal utilizes the  LOCKSS system to create a distributed archiving system among participating libraries and permits those libraries to create permanent archives of the journal for purposes of preservation and restoration. The publisher perpetually authorizes participants in the LOCKSS system to archive and restore our publication through the LOCKSS System for the benefit of all LOCKSS System participants. Specifically participating libraries may:  Collect and preserve currently accessible materials;  Use material consistent with original license terms;  Provide copies to other LOCKSS appliances for purposes of audit and repair.        Fair Use The U.S. Copyright Act of 1976 specifies, in Section 107, the terms of the Fair Use exception: Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:  the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  the nature of the copyrighted work;  the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; &amp;  the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.   The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors. In accord with these provisions, the  International Journal of Communication  believes in the vigorous assertion and defense of Fair Use by scholars engaged in academic research, teaching and non-commercial publishing. Thus, we view the inclusion of “quotations” from existing print, visual, audio and audio-visual texts to be appropriate examples of Fair Use, as are reproductions of visual images for the purpose of scholarly analysis. We encourage authors to obtain appropriate permissions to use materials originally produced by others, but do not require such permissions as long as the usage of such materials falls within the boundaries of Fair Use.  The  International Journal of Communication  encourages authors to employ fair use in their scholarly publishing wherever appropriate. Fair use is the right to use unlicensed copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your own work, in some circumstances. We consult the  Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Scholarly Research in Communication , created by the International Communication Association and endorsed by the National Communication Association, and you should too. If you have any questions about whether fair use applies to your uses of copyrighted material (whether it is text, images, audio-visual, or other) in your scholarship, simply include your rationale, grounded in the Best Practices, as a supplementary document with your submission.",,,,ijoc.org,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/2TL8TJ3Z/1618.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/M2HJIAD3/Christen - 2012 - Does Information Really Want to be Free Indigenou.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.7763/ijiet.2012.v2.207,,29.44635,,"What Knowledge Exists about Drinking Water and Academic Achievements in Schools in Ghana, Sierra Leone and South Africa?",

The bequest by Broun of a major collection to the British Museum (Natural History), and the retention of other collections here in private hands rather than a public institution, severely restricted research on beetles in New Zealand for 40 years. Today most primary type specimens of New Zealand species remain overseas, and this is still an impediment to research in this country. Other important collections of New Zealand beetles and their present locations are discussed briefly. Current and recent work and publications by coleopterists on the New Zealand fauna are outlined briefly, including studies to be published soon in the “Fauna of New Zealand” series. The 91 families of Coleoptera (Crowson's classification) known to occur in New Zealand are tabulated, with numbers of presently published species (excluding synonyms) for New Zealand, North America, Britain, Australia, and the world. Counts of species actually present and recognised in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection are recorded: these total 4520 + native and 302 introduced species. It is estimated that the number of real species of Coleoptera in New Zealand considerably exceeds 5000. Relationships of the fauna are discussed briefly. “Cyphaleus” valdivianus from Chile is transferred from Tenebrionidae to Chalcodryidae.",1982-01-01,2020-06-02 11:15:55,2020-06-02 11:15:55,2020-06-02 11:15:55,213-221,,3,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00779962.1982.9722384,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/IULV8Z2D/00779962.1982.html,,,collections; “Cyphaleus” valdivianus; Chalcodryidae; Coleoptera; fauna; New Zealand; systematics; T.

Within a Māori (indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) worldview, genomic data obtained from taonga (treasured) species has whakapapa – generally defined as genealogy, whakapapa layers the contemporary, historical and mythological aspects of bioheritage – thus genomic data obtained from taonga species are taonga in their own right and are best studied using Māori principles. We contend it is the responsibility of researchers working with genomic data from taonga species to move beyond one-off Māori consultation toward building meaningful relationships with relevant Māori communities. Here, we reflect on our experience embedding Māori principles in genomics research as leaders of a BioHeritage National Science Challenge project entitled ‘Characterising adaptive variation inAotearoa New Zealand’s terrestrial and freshwater biota’. We are co-developing a culturallyresponsive evidence-based position statement regarding the benefits and risks of prioritising adaptive potential to build resilience in threatened taonga species, including species destined for customary or commercial harvest. To achieve this, we co-developed a research programme with the local subtribe, Ngāi Tūāhuriri, that integrates Māori knowledge with emerging genomic technologies and extensive ecological data for two taonga species, kōwaro (Canterbury mudfish; Neochanna burrowsius) and kēkēwai (freshwater crayfish; Paranephrops zealandicus). The foundation of our research programme is an iterative decision-making framework that includes tissue sampling as well as data generation, storage and access. Beyond upholding the promises made in The Treaty of Waitangi, we contend the integration of Māori principles in genomics research will enhance the recovery of taonga species and enable the realisation of Māori values.",2019-12-07,2020-06-02 11:15:40,2020-06-02 11:15:40,2020-06-02 11:15:40,,,3,43.0,,,Embedding indigenous principles in genomic research of culturally significant species,,,,,,en,,,,,Crossref,,,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/IVKYQK63/School of Biological Sciences, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand et al. - 2019 - Embedding indigenous principles in genomic researc.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['*WORK IN'],['*WORK IN'],False,False,False,False,True,,,Error: No affiliations provided,12,10.20417/nzjecol.43.36,,exact,,Embedding indigenous principles in genomic research of culturally significant species: a conservation genomics case study,

There is a diverse and rich tradition of folklore, regional crafts and arts, and folk culture within the Carpathian area. We are interested in looking at its cross-border similarities, common history and cultural roots. The goal of the project is to collect bibliography, source material, photo and audiovisual material on authentic folklore of the region, make it available on Wikimedia Commons – and use it for better coverage of related articles on Wikipedia (in English and relevant local languages). The main focus is on regional costume, regional museums, folk arts and crafts and local vernacular architecture.    Teams consisting of Wikipedians, ethnographers from the National Museum of Ethnography in Warsaw, and international volunteers will travel to several Central European destinations in order to document folk culture in Wikipedias and Wikimedia Commons. All team members will also write, expand and illustrate a predefined set of related articles on related language versions of Wikipedia. See the lists of articles. Wikipedians from the team establish contacts with Wikipedians from all the countries visited, inform them about the project in advance, and get them involved in editing, as well as in local training workshops and documentation trips. Each trip will be linked to at least one museum of ethnography in the visited region, with whom the team will collaborate on the project (see list of museums below). We will also conduct a basic wikiworkshop for local residents and staff in one museum in each country.",2017-10-29,2020-05-29 17:33:48,2020-05-29 17:33:59,2020-05-29 17:33:48,,,,,,,Wikipedia,,,,,,en,Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License,,,,,,Page Version ID: 807677150,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/W434LNXR/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,,,Error: Type not supported,,Error: Type not supported,,,

While Tuck and Yang position settler colonial spatiality as structured by a settler-native-slave triad, we argue that their critique of metaphor entails the collapse of the triad into a settler-native dyad, the reduction of slavery to forced labour, and a division between the material and the symbolic that forecloses not only an analysis of slavery, but also the constitution of settler colonialism itself. Through an immanent critique of “Decolonization is Not a Metaphor” we identify what animates their critique of metaphor, and drawing on scholarship in Black studies, we offer an alternative theorisation of slavery and settler colonialism.",2020,2020-05-29 14:52:44,2020-05-29 14:52:44,2020-05-29 14:52:44,764-782,,3,52.0,,,Slavery is a Metaphor,,,,,,en,© 2020 The Author.

While these and other incidents make contemporary headlines, American Indians often experience these claims within a historical and continuing experience of dispossession. For hundreds of years, the U.S. legal system has sanctioned the taking and destruction of Indian lands, artifacts, bodies, religions, identities, and beliefs, all toward the project of conquest and colonization. Indian resources have been devalued by the law and made available for non-Indians to use for their own purposes. Seeking redresses for the losses caused by these actions, tribes have brought claims under a variety of laws, from trademark and copyright to the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment, and some have been more successful than others. As a matter of property law, courts have compensated—albeit incompletely—the taking of certain Indian lands and have also come to recognize tribal interests in human remains, gravesites, and associated artifacts. When it comes to intangible property, however, the situation is more complicated. It is difficult for legal decision makers and scholars alike to understand why Indian tribes should be able to regulate the use of Indian names, symbols, and expressions. Indeed, non-Indians often claim interests, sounding in free speech and the public domain, in the very same resources. To advance understanding of this contested area of law, this Article situates intangible cultural property claims in a larger history of the legal dispossession of Indian property—a phenomenon we call “Indian appropriation.” It then evaluates these claims vis-à-vis prevailing legal doctrine and offers a normative view of solutions, both legal and extralegal.Published: Angela R.

K39FDRLH,book,2018.0,"Aufderheide, Patricia; Jaszi, Peter",Reclaiming Fair Use,,,,,https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo28242133.html,"In the increasingly complex and combative arena of copyright in the digital age, record companies sue college students over peer-to-peer music sharing, YouTube removes home movies because of a song playing in the background, and filmmakers are denied a distribution deal when a permissions i proves undottable. Analyzing the dampening effect that copyright law can have on scholarship and creativity, Patricia Aufderheide and Peter Jaszi urge us to embrace in response a principle embedded in copyright law itself—fair use. Originally published in 2011, Reclaiming Fair Use challenged the widely held notion that copyright law is obsolete in an age of digital technologies. Beginning with a survey of the contemporary landscape of copyright law, Aufderheide and Jaszi drew on their years of experience advising documentary filmmakers, English teachers, performing arts scholars, and other creative professionals to lay out in detail how the principles of fair-use can be employed to avoid copyright violation. Taking stock of the vibrant remix culture that has only burgeoned since the book’s original publication, this new edition addresses the expanded reach of fair use—tracking the Twitter hashtag #WTFU (where’s the fair use?), the maturing of the transformativeness measure in legal disputes, the ongoing fight against automatic detection software, and the progress and delays of digitization initiatives around the country. Full of no-nonsense advice and practical examples, Reclaiming Fair Use remains essential reading for anyone interested in law, creativity, and the ever-broadening realm of new media.",2018,2020-05-23 15:57:24,2020-05-29 00:28:41,2020-05-23 15:57:24,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Chicago Press,,,,,,press.uchicago.edu,,,,/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/GRFQG3I4/bo28242133.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[],[],False,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,4,10.7208/chicago/9780226374222.001.0001,,75.64137,,Reclaiming Fair Use,

This paper attempts to quantify the societal value of the WC by tracking the downstream use of images found on the platform.

We detect 54,758 downstream uses of the initial sample and we characterise these at the level of generic and country-code top-level domains (TLDs). We analyse the impact of speci�c variables on the odds that an image is used. The random sampling technique enables us to estimate overall value of all images contained on the platform.

These solutions facilitate discovery, opening avenues for research into the ethics of ownership that cross the physical/digital divide.

In a museum context, copyright is a technical practice which illuminates how museums imagine and manage their own organizational legitimacy – a settlement which has often operated through a ‘public interest argument’ (‘we need you to hand over control of your object/story for the benefit of all’). Drawing on interviews with people who work in museums and those who have taken part in a museum participation project, we focus on a digital storytelling project to show how copyright was deployed to make an in-practice argument for the how museums might legitimately relate personal story telling with the ‘public interest’. The project did this through three processes: coming into the public via managing informed consent through evoking future audiences, making an author through creating intentional decisions and ‘responsibilization’ and making an object by transforming a digital story into a ‘finished’ object which is, in turn, transferred into the museum collections. While those involved in the project recognized they had signed over the rights to their story and were, in most cases, broadly happy with this – ‘that’s what the form was for’, as one put it – the personal nature of the story itself (linked to personal memories, friends and family) and the sociality of the process of making it (in a group; through interactions with museum staff) was also emphasized. This sociality was expressed in the sense that participants would like to be told when a story is going to be re-displayed, be sent drafts of interpretation and be invited to the opening of the exhibition – a mode of relationship with the museum consistently described as ‘courtesy’. The article concludes by suggesting that the expectation of courtesy – though it might seem like a very modest claim – does something to museums and makes way for more nuanced asymmetries within the public interest argument. Rather than assuming that ‘the public interest’ lies in treating people (slightly coldly) in the same way, the lens of courtesy might suggest ways of both respecting the importance of the public ethos (for institutions to address themselves to ideas of fairness, inclusion and equality) yet might also work to socialize this impulse and reimagine a responsive public museum from the bottom up.",2013,2020-05-23 16:05:30,2020-05-23 16:05:30,2020-05-23 16:05:30,105-121,,2,11.0,,,The Personal is still Political,,,,,,en,"Copyright (c) 2015 Helen Graham, Rhiannon Mason, Nigel Nayling",,,,journals.le.ac.uk,,Number: 2,,"/home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/8IPAAAPH/228.html; /home/diegodlh/Zotero/storage/VJ8SAFC4/Graham et al. - 2013 - The Personal is still Political Museums, Particip.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 2'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,,,Error: No affiliations provided,2,10.3167/armw.2013.010104,,48.074066,,"National Museums, Globalization, and Postnationalism",
795KA4CF,book,2016.0,"Röschenthaler, Ute; Diawara, Mamadou","Copyright Africa: How intellectual property, media and markets transform immaterial cultural goods",,978-1-907774-42-3,,,,"Africa is known for its multi-faceted immaterial culture, manifested in highly original music, oral texts, artistic performances and sporting events. These cultural expressions are increasingly regulated by intellectual property rights, as orally transmitted stories are written down, traditional songs broadcast and ownership claimed, and sporting activities once part of village life become national media events. This volume brings together an interdisciplinary team of legal experts, anthropologists and literary scholars to explore, from an African point of view, what happens to intangible cultural goods when they are confronted with large-scale commodification and distribution through media technologies, and globalized and divergent judicial systems, institutions and cultural norms. These transformations are observed in contexts that range from Senegalese wrestling contests to beauty pageants in Mali, from Kenyan hip-hop to the Nigerian novel, from the vuvuzela horn to Cameroonian masks. Contributors address the role of the state and the legacy of the European origination of IP laws, as well as the forms of ownership, technologies of mediation and degrees of commercialization that existed pre-colonially in different African societies. Resisting a single narrative of the imposition of a Western legal regime displacing older African modes, a more complex picture is revealed of the intricate interconnections between pirates, artists, communities, governments and international organizations. It is only when local actors embrace technologies and regulations in a specific historical situation that these become influential forces for change. The question raised is not whether international IP norms conform to African practices, nor whether media impose Western styles, but rather what local actors do with these regulations and how both local and Western practices and technologies impact on each other and co-exist.",2016-02-15,2020-05-23 14:46:02,2020-05-23 14:46:02,,,408.0,,,,,Copyright Africa,,,,,Sean Kingston Publishing,English,,,,,Amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['**CITED > ALREADY CITED > Section 3'],['**CITED'],True,False,False,False,False,"Goethe University, Germany","['Goethe University, Germany']","[['Goethe University, Germany'], ['Goethe University, Germany']]",2,10.4018/978-1-5225-2095-5.ch006,,57.004616,,"Copying, Branding, and the Ethical Implications of Rights in Immaterial Cultural Goods",Canon Pyon
